## 1. Building Layouts

*Take your hand drawn app designs and lay them out on the phone screen.*

#### Lesson
 * You will learn about various Views and ViewGroups used to make layouts for your Android apps. 
 * You will learn the XML markup language used to lay out Android applications. 
 * You will create views, the basic building block of Android layouts, that display text and images. 
 * You will position your text and images on these screens. 

#### Topics
1. [XML Visualizer](http://labs.udacity.com/android-visualizer/#/android/sandbox)
2. Writing XML
2. TextViews 
3. ImageViews
3. Styling your views
4. Positioning your views with ViewGroups
5. LinearLayout weight
6. Using RelativeLayout to position views relative to each other

#### Practice Project: Birthday Card App

1. Download Android Studio
2. Make a Hello World Application and run it on your phone
3. Create a Birthday Card Application
4. Create a custom card & video for the [Make Your Own Card](http://discussions.udacity.com/t/make-your-own-card/19643) showcase!

## 2. Making an App Interactive

*Harness the power of Java to create an interactive coffee ordering app!* 


#### Lesson
* You will start by writing simple statements in Java that add interactivity to your app.
* You will then incorporate buttons to trigger events. 
* You will finally use a fundamental concept in programming, a variable, to keep track of all the coffee drinks ordered.

#### Topics
* Making a button click execute code
* Having the app evaluate math expressions
* Declaring, initializing and using variables
* Variable scope
* Nested layouts
* The String datatype
* Combining Strings, ints and variables with concatenation

#### Practice Project: Basketball Score Tracker App
1. Identify incorrect variable declarations and initializations
2. Determine program output
3. Determine whether variables should be local or global
4. Build the CourtCounter basketball scoring app seen below:

## 3. Object Oriented Programming

*Take a deeper dive into the Android Framework to complete the Just Java coffee ordering app!* 

#### Lesson
* You will see in more detail how Android works behind the scenes.
* You will take your first steps towards learning Object Oriented Programming. 
* You will add the ability to add toppings to your coffee
* You will show a detailed order summary when the customer purchases a coffee.

#### Topics
* Method declaration and calling
* Parameters and return values
* An introduction to Object Oriented Programming
* Changing the attributes of your views dynamically
* Creating conditional logic using if/else statements


## Final Project

#### Teach Five Things App
* Plan out your app design prior to coding, based on user feedback and needs
* Take an app layout from drawing to XML code
* Create, position, and style views
* Create interactivity through button clicks and Java code
