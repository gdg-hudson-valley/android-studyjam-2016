# [1A: Building Layouts](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud837/l-4027328704)

This section trail can be broken into three parts
* Learn how to **SELECT** views for your user interface
* Learn how to **CUSTOMIZE** the selected views, and
* Learn how to **POSITION** those views on the screen

The lessons will go into more detail on both the terminology and the code required to make these happen. 

However, beginners can always check out the [**Vocab Words Glossary**](https://developers.google.com/android/for-all/vocab-words/) from Android Developers for a quick reference to terminology along with sample code to demonstrate key concepts.

A **View** in Android is just a rectangle on the screen that shows some content.
* TextView - line of text
* ImageView - shows an image
* Button - shows a clickable button

A **Layout** is the collection of views that make up one screen of your Android app.

A **User Interface** (or UI) refers collectively to everything you can see and interact with in that app. Think of the UI being a collection of screens (layout), with each screen containing many components (views) that the user can interact with.
