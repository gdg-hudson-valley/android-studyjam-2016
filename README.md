# Study Jams: Android For Beginners

The [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/groups/) Study Jams is a free series of global, community-run, in-person study groups. The [first Study Jams series](http://developerstudyjams.com/) ran in 2015 in partnership with Udacity, and focused on their [Android Fundamentals curriculum](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud853) targeting participants with some coding background.

## About This Jam
Based on insights from that first run, the second series of Study Jams in 2016 will run from Feb-May and focus on the [Udacity "Android for Beginners"](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud837) curriculum. This version targets absolute beginners -- anyone who has no programming experience, or has programmed with a language other than Android. You can find out more about the course content and materials on the [Udacity Course Wiki](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud837).


## About This Book
This book is created by [GDG Hudson Valley](http://www.meetup.com/gdg-hudson-valley/) for use in their 2016 Study Jam. As with 2015, the goal is to make this an open-source effort that anyone can contribute either by requesting to be added as a direct collaborator, or by generating pull requests to our repo. The current version of this book will be available online at GitBook.
